    text: 'Education Attainment. How much text can fit here ...... The improving state of education in EAP means that deprivations in education enrollment are typically lower than deprivations in education attainment (Figure 7). Education enrollment is measured as enrollment of school-aged children, while education attainment measures completed education of adults in the household. In the region, monetary poverty is less correlated with education deprivations than with access to infrastructure deprivations, partly because compulsory education is becoming the norm. Most children are obtaining education levels higher than their parents, which is measured by absolute education mobility. In EAP, absolute education mobility among the latest generation of adults (those born in the 1980s) is on par with the average for high-income economies and is significantly higher than the average for developing economies (Narayan and Yang, 2018). However, other issues related to quality and equal access to a quality education are still concerns in some countries (Crawford et al, 2018).',
