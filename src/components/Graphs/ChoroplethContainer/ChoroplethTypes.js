    text: 'Education Attainment. The improving state of education in EAP means that deprivations in education enrollment are typically lower than deprivations in education attainment. Education enrollment is measured as enrollment of school-aged children, while education attainment measures completed education of adults in the household. In the region, monetary poverty is less correlated with education deprivations than with access to infrastructure deprivations, partly because compulsory education is becoming the norm. Most children are obtaining education levels higher than their parents, which is measured by absolute education mobility. In EAP, absolute education mobility among the latest generation of adults (those born in the 1980s) is on par with the average for high-income economies and is significantly higher than the average for developing economies. However, other issues related to quality and equal access to a quality education are still concerns in some countries.',

    text: 'Sanitation. Deprivations in access to limited-standard sanitation and water are high in many countries. Populations in regions with low monetary poverty, such as East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Middle East and North Africa, suffer a sanitation deprivation rate several times as high as that in the monetary dimension. In developing East Asia and Pacific, the difference in monetary and non-monetary poverty can be related to cheap products and poor infrastructure. Low international monetary poverty in some developing East Asia and Pacific countries is related to goods typically being cheaper than critical services, though at the same time infrastructure can be poor, resulting in deprivations in access to limited-standard sanitation and drinking water.',
