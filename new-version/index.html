          <p>Our conceptualization of what poverty is in the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region should adapt as incomes and aspirations rise in these middle income countries.</p>
          <p>A larger suite of poverty indicators helps to broaden our view and understanding of poverty. Monitoring poverty at higher poverty lines is increasingly important as countries grow richer, and people's conceptions of poverty and the standards of living they aspire to are much higher. At the same time, poverty is a complex and multifaceted problem. In addition to monetary deprivation, individuals may suffer from lack of access to basic infrastructure, education, and other critical services. </p>
          <p>A broader view of poverty reveals there is still much work to be done in developing EAP, even though extreme poverty is now less prevalent.</p>

          <p>Monitoring poverty at higher poverty lines is increasingly important as countries grow richer. A poverty line that is too low can lead to an inaccurate assessment of an individual’s ability to function in society in a socially acceptable manner. Participation in society with dignity may require more goods in a richer country than in a poorer country. Social participation might thus be more closely related to the concept of meeting basic needs in the poorest of countries, but in richer countries, the ability to participate in society might be costlier.</p>

          <h2>In 2018, about a quarter of developing EAP were middle-class.</h2>
          <p>While EAP has been extremely successful at reducing poverty, building large middle-class societies may be more challenging for the region. Outside of EAP’s wealthiest countries, the middle-class is small in size or growing slowly. In the Philippines, the size of the middle-class has hardly changed over the last decade.</p>
          <p>Growth strategies that helped to eradicate extreme poverty in most of developing EAP will likely not be sufficient to also lift households into the middle-class. Outward oriented growth, basic human capital development, and sound economic governance helped lift a billion people in EAP out of extreme poverty. Yet, these foundational policies will not guarantee that a billion people will also be lifted into the middle-class. The EAP regional middle-class poverty line is almost eight times higher than the international poverty line. Countries and challenges are also evolving. Even as the size of the middle-class is increasing, middle-class households can still be exposed to risks and fall back into poverty. This is a relevant concern as the region experiences uncertainties from trade tensions and slowing growth.</p>

          <p>In 2018, 538 million in developing EAP were economically insecure and lived on less than $5.50 a day. The poverty threshold used to define economic security is less than three times higher than the threshold used to measure extreme poverty. Yet, the population of economically insecure is almost eighteen times more than the number of extreme poor.</p>
          <p>The largest differences in the number of poor by these classifications are in the region’s most populous countries. For example, in 2015, about 10 million Chinese were extreme poor, compared with 373 million economically insecure.</p>
          <p>Average regional poverty rates are much higher when excluding China. The poverty rate in developing EAP excluding China is 4 percent, compared to 1.5 percent when China is included. While developing EAP's progress on poverty reduction is impressive, monitoring poverty for each country individually is also important.</p>

        <p class="step">The size of the bubbles on the graph on the right shows the number of poor, according to three poverty lines.</p>
        <p class="step">In developing EAP in 2018, an estimated 30 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day, while 168 million lived on less than $3.20 a day, and 538 million on less than $5.50 a day. Although $5.50 is slightly less than three times higher than the International poverty line ($1.90 a day), the number of poor at this higher line is almost eighteen times more than the number of extreme poor because such a large proportion of the population lives between $1.90/day and $5.50/day.</p>
        <p class="step">China has experienced very successful poverty reduction and has a low poverty rate. Poverty rates in the region are much higher when excluding China. The poverty rate in developing EAP excluding China is 4 percent, compared to 1.5 percent when China is included.</p>
        <p class="step">Even though the UMIC poverty line is less than three times higher than the IPL, the number of UMIC poor is almost 18 times more than the number of extreme poor because a much larger proportion of the population lives between $1.9/day and $5.5/day. Differences in EAP’s most populous countries are also the most significant. For example, 9.9 million Chinese were poor as measured by the IPL in 2015, compared to 373.1 million using the UMIC poverty line. Similarly, in Indonesia, 15.1 and 155.4 million were poor in 2017 based on the International and UMIC poverty lines respectively.</p>

        <h2>Developing EAP is a diverse region, with some areas still facing daunting challenges</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>While many countries in EAP have made good progress in tackling poverty, it is important to bear in mind that developing EAP is a diverse region and includes sub-regions that still face daunting poverty reduction challenges. Residents of EAP live at all levels of economic well-being, stability, and environmental fragility. Eight out of <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/892921532529834051/FCSList-FY19-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36 countries</a> in fragile, conflict, or violent (FCV) settings worldwide are located in EAP. Even in relatively stable countries, FCV areas exist; such as Southern Thailand and Mindanao, Philippines. Most developing EAP countries are island nations, which are frequently hit by natural disasters. These disasters are not limited to the seasonal and somewhat predictable, but also include earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that are less foreseeable.</p>
          <p>Large variation in poverty rates exists both within and across countries. Across 78 sub-regions, the $3.20/day poverty rate ranges from 0 percent in Bangkok, Thailand (2017) to 84.5 percent in Oecussi, Timor-Leste (2014). In non-monetary poverty, material deprivations in access to water and sanitation are also higher in rural areas. Developing EAP’s many mountainous regions and remote islands may exacerbate unequal access to services. A more granular view of non-monetary poverty has implications for policy by revealing the types of deprivations of overall disadvantage.</p>

          <p><strong>Education Attainment</strong></p>
          <p>The improving state of education in EAP means that deprivations in education enrollment are typically lower than deprivations in education attainment (Figure 7). Education enrollment is measured as enrollment of school-aged children, while education attainment measures completed education of adults in the household. In the region, monetary poverty is less correlated with education deprivations than with access to infrastructure deprivations, partly because compulsory education is becoming the norm. Most children are obtaining education levels higher than their parents, which is measured by absolute education mobility. In EAP, absolute education mobility among the latest generation of adults (those born in the 1980s) is on par with the average for high-income economies and is significantly higher than the average for developing economies (Narayan and Yang, 2018). However, other issues related to quality and equal access to a quality education are still concerns in some countries (Crawford et al, 2018).</p>

          <p>Our conceptualization of what poverty is in developing East Asia and Pacific should adapt as incomes and aspirations rise, and countries work on expanding their middle-class societies and transitioning to high-income status. As societies prosper, higher standards for monitoring refer not only to higher poverty lines to account for higher costs of living in wealthier societies but also to accessible and high-quality public services. A broader view of poverty, including higher poverty lines and multidimensional poverty measures, reveals there is still much work to be done in middle-income countries, even though extreme poverty is now less prevalent.</p>
          <p>This view helps to enhance policy dialogue and craft policies that are more relevant and targeted. A larger suite of global measures, grounded in tools that countries already use to monitor progress, can facilitate enhanced dialogue by offering a rich set of comparable instruments for countries to assess their performance. To facilitate relevant and targeted policies, new and existing indicators should be monitored in a more disaggregated manner, both geographically as well as at the individual level. When this is done, pockets of poor are more noticeable, even in relatively well-off countries.</p>
