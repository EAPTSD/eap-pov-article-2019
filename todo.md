Change requests:
Use static graphs for everything but choropleth
The two bubble charts can be left and right static with the text scrolling in the middle.
The 4 bar chart states can be small multiples across the screen at desktop and in a 2x2 square at mobile. Or it can be toggleable. Recommend static images even for this.
The bar chart should also be something like a streamgraph or a stacked graph or Stacked Spline Area Chart.
I honestly think it's more useful and readable (not to mention it's simpler to reimplement.)
The choropleth on the other hand is still good to be dynamic.
The dot navigation becomes a bit meaningless when there are so many indistinguishable dots. A sidebar with section text and highlighting the current section would be more informative imho.
