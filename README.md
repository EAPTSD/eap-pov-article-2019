# A Broader View of Poverty in developing East Asia and Pacific


This [article](https://eaptsd.github.io/eap-pov-article-2019/) visualizes a broader view of poverty in the developing East Asia and Pacific region by discussing pieces of the poverty puzzle introduced in the [2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity) flagship. These new indicators complement the existing World Bank twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 

The full article on <i>Piecing together the Poverty Puzzle in the East Asia and Pacific region</i> can be found in Part 2A in the Spring 2019â€™s edition of the [East Asia and Pacific Economic Update](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31500).

The East Asia and Pacific Team for Statistical Development is a regional statistics team in the Poverty & Equity Global Practice of the World Bank. The team also works closely with the EAP Office of the Chief Economist.
