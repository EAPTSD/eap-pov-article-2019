        <h2>Almost a billion people in developing EAP have been lifted out of extreme poverty over the past quarter century.</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Today, the majority of developing EAP is no longer in extreme poverty, as measured by the International Poverty Line (IPL, $1.90/day 2011PPP). Outward oriented growth, basic human capital development, and sound economic governance helped lift a billion people in EAP out of extreme poverty. The more prosperous countries in the region, such as China, Malaysia, and Thailand have extreme poverty rates less than 1 percent. </p>

        <h2>The International Poverty Line may be now too low to define whether someone is poor in developing EAP.</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>As countries have grown economically, the yardstick for measuring extreme poverty based on the International Poverty Line (IPL) has gradually become less relevant to the developing East Asia and Pacific region, which is today comprised exclusively of low and upper middle-income countries.</p>
          <p>How we conceptualize what poverty is in the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region should also adapt as incomes and aspirations rise.</p>
          <p>A larger suite of poverty indicators broadens our view and understanding of poverty. Monitoring poverty using higher standards is increasingly important as countries grow richer, and people's conceptions of poverty and the standards of living they aspire to are much higher. At the same time, poverty is a complex and multifaceted problem. In addition to monetary deprivation, individuals may suffer from lack of access to basic infrastructure, education, and other critical services. </p>
          <p>A broader view of poverty reveals there is still much work to be done in developing EAP, even though extreme poverty is now less prevalent.</p>

        <h2>At higher standards, half a billion people are still not economically secure</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>In 2018, 538 million in developing EAP were economically insecure (defined as those living below $5.5/day 2011PPP). The population of economically insecure is almost eighteen times more than the number of extreme poor. The largest differences in the number of poor by these classifications are in the region’s most populous countries. For example, in 2015, about 10 million Chinese were extreme poor, compared with 373 million economically insecure.</p>
          <p>Monitoring poverty at higher poverty lines is  important as countries in developing EAP grow richer. A poverty line that is too low can lead to an inaccurate assessment of an individual’s ability to function in society in a socially acceptable manner. Participation in society with dignity may require more goods in a richer country than in a poorer country. As aspirations rise, so should our concepts of minimum standards.</p>

            <p>Average regional poverty rates are much higher when excluding China. The regional poverty rate in developing EAP excluding China is 4 percent, compared to 1.5 percent when China is included. In 2002, the majority of the extreme poor was in China.

          <p>While EAP has been extremely successful at reducing poverty, building large middle-class societies may be more challenging for the region. The foundational policies that lifted a billion people out of extreme poverty cannot guarantee to also lift a billion people into the middle class. In 2018, about a quarter of developing EAP were middle-class. Though, outside of EAP’s wealthiest countries, the middle class is small in size or growing slowly. The growth of the middle class in China is impressive. In 2002, the size of the middle class in China and the rest of devleoping EAP was similar in population: 19 and 25 million respectively. The middle class in China has since grown much faster and outpaced the rest of region. In the Philippines, the size of the middle class has hardly changed over the last decade.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Large variation in monetary poverty and non-monetary deprivation rates exists both within and across countries. In non-monetary dimensions, material deprivations in access to water and sanitation are higher in rural areas. Developing EAP’s many mountainous regions and remote islands may exacerbate unequal access to services. A more granular view of non-monetary poverty has implications for policy by revealing the types of deprivations of overall disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Deprivation rates in education and access to services are higher in rural areas; households that are not monetarily poor may lack adequate schooling or  access  to  basic  infrastructure  services.  Meanwhile,  in  urban  areas  of  developing  East  Asia  and  Pacific,  there exists better availability and access to public services. </p>

             <p>While many countries in EAP have made good progress in tackling poverty, it is important to bear in mind that developing EAP is a diverse region and includes countries and sub-regions that still face daunting poverty reduction challenges. Residents of EAP live at all levels of economic well-being, stability, and environmental fragility. Eight out of <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/892921532529834051/FCSList-FY19-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36 countries</a> in fragile, conflict, or violent (FCV) settings worldwide are located in EAP. Even in relatively stable countries, FCV areas exist; such as Southern Thailand and Mindanao, Philippines. Most developing EAP countries are island nations, which are frequently hit by natural disasters. These disasters are not limited to the seasonal and somewhat predictable, but also include earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that are less foreseeable.</p>

        <h2>As developing EAP continues to prosper, how we conceptualize poverty should also adapt</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>As societies prosper, higher standards for monitoring refer not only to higher poverty lines to account for higher costs of living in wealthier societies but also to accessible and high-quality public services. A broader view of poverty, including higher poverty lines and multidimensional poverty measures, reveals there is still much work to be done in middle-income countries, even though extreme poverty is now less prevalent.</p>

          <p>This view helps to enhance policy dialogue and craft policies that are more relevant and targeted. A larger suite of global measures, grounded in tools that countries already use to monitor progress, can facilitate enhanced dialogue by offering a rich set of comparable instruments for countries to assess their performance. To facilitate relevant and targeted policies, new and existing indicators should be monitored in a more disaggregated manner, both geographically as well as at the individual level. When this is done, pockets of poor are more noticeable, even in relatively well-off countries.</p>
